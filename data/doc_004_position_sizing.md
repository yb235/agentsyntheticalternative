# Position Sizing & Risk Management

## The Fundamental Truth

**Position size matters more than being right.**

You can have the best analysis, be directionally correct, and still lose money if your position is too large.

## My Framework: 50-30-20

Inspired by Buffett but adapted to my psychology:

- **50%**: High conviction, thoroughly researched positions
  - 2-3 positions max
  - Companies I'd hold for 3+ years
  - Example: NVDA, GOOGL

- **30%**: Medium conviction, good companies but less certain
  - 3-4 positions
  - 1-2 year holding period
  - Example: NET, DDOG

- **20%**: Cash or speculative plays
  - Dry powder for opportunities
  - Small bets on high-risk/reward ideas
  - Never all in

## Position Sizing Rules

**Individual positions**:
- Max 15% for high conviction (reduced from 20% after losses)
- Max 7% for medium conviction
- Max 3% for speculative plays

**Psychological sizing**:
- If position keeps you up at night → Too big
- If 20% drawdown would cause panic → Too big
- If you check price every hour → Too big

The right size is one where you can handle volatility without emotional decisions.

## Building Positions

**Never** deploy all capital at once. Even in high conviction ideas.

My approach:
1. Initial position: 1/3 of intended size
2. Add after thesis is validated: 1/3 more
3. Final add only if significantly undervalued: final 1/3

**Exception**: If thesis is broken, don't add. Cut and move on.

## The Concentration Debate

Buffett says "diversification is protection against ignorance."
Munger says "Three good ideas in a lifetime is enough."

But they're Buffett and Munger. I'm not.

For me:
- Too concentrated (1-2 stocks): One mistake wipes you out
- Too diversified (20+ stocks): Can't research properly, closet indexing

**Sweet spot**: 5-7 positions, with conviction scaling

## Risk Management

**Hard rules**:
- Stop loss at -25% (either thesis broken or I was very wrong)
- No averaging down (exceptions only after deep re-analysis)
- Macro risk: Never more than 50% in one sector

**Soft guidelines**:
- Prefer asymmetric bets (limited downside, unlimited upside)
- Correlation matters: Don't have 5 cloud software companies
- Cash is a position: 20% minimum for opportunities

## Learning from Mistakes

**2021 mistake**: 25% in BABA, lost heavily
- Lesson: Never bet against government (CCP risk was real)
- Lesson: Position was too big for the uncertainty

**2022 mistake**: Too many positions (12 at peak)
- Couldn't research properly
- Closet indexing without benefits
- Simplified to 5 core positions

## The Psychology Connection

Position sizing IS psychology management:
- Right size → Can hold through volatility → Let winners run
- Wrong size → Panic selling → Cut winners early, hold losers

Most "trading psychology" problems are actually position sizing problems in disguise.
