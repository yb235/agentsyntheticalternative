# Post-Mortem: 2022 Q1 Losses

## What Happened

Lost 15% of portfolio in Q1 2022. Three major mistakes:

### Trade 1: SOXS Disaster (-8%)
- Bought SOXS (bearish semiconductor ETF) thinking chip shortage would cause crash
- **Mistake**: Macro directional trade, against my rules
- **Psychology**: Was restless, wanted to "do something"
- **Lesson**: Macro trades NEVER work for me

### Trade 2: Snapchat (-4%)
- Bought SNAP at $35, sold at $25 in panic
- **Mistake**: No written thesis, bought on momentum
- **Psychology**: FOMO after seeing friends make money
- **Lesson**: Thesis-less trades are gambling

### Trade 3: Multiple small cuts (-3%)
- Death by thousand cuts from intraday trades
- **Mistake**: Screen-watching after coffee
- **Psychology**: Caffeinated, impulsive
- **Lesson**: Coffee → Losses (proved again)

## Common Patterns

All three mistakes share common threads:
1. No written thesis
2. Emotional/impulsive state
3. Violated my own rules
4. Forced trades when no clear opportunity

## Prevention Strategy

### Pre-Trade Checklist (NEW)
- [ ] Am I calm and well-rested?
- [ ] Have I had coffee today? (If yes, stop)
- [ ] Do I have a written thesis?
- [ ] Is this a macro trade? (If yes, stop)
- [ ] Would I be comfortable holding through 20% drawdown?

### Position Sizing Rules (UPDATED)
- Max 10% per position (was 15%)
- Max 5% for speculative plays
- No more than 3 positions at once
- Keep 20% cash always

## Psychological Insight

The real issue isn't analytical ability - it's **execution discipline**.

I know what to do, but I don't do it consistently.

**Root cause**: Restless mental state → Need to act → Break rules → Losses

**Solution**: Fix the mental state FIRST, then trade. Or don't trade at all.

## Commitment

From today (April 2022):
- No trading if I've had coffee
- Written thesis mandatory (template created)
- No macro directional trades, EVER
- If I break a rule, stop trading for 1 week

This isn't optional anymore. These rules exist because I've proven I need them.
