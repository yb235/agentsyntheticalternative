# The Patience Paradox

## The Central Tension

Two competing beliefs I hold:

**Belief A**: "Sit tight. Big money is made in waiting, not trading."
- Jesse Livermore's wisdom
- Supported by my best returns (NVDA: 18 months, 300%)
- Charlie Munger: "The big money is in the waiting"

**Belief B**: "Be an early believer. Act before confirmation."
- Missed Tesla by waiting for "confirmation"
- Missed Luckin Coffee by being too cautious
- Early believers make the most

## The Apparent Contradiction

These seem to conflict:
- How can I both "sit tight" AND "act early"?
- How can I be patient AND aggressive?

## Resolution Attempt #1: Different Contexts

Maybe they apply to different situations:
- **Sit tight**: AFTER you've entered a position
- **Act early**: BEFORE entry, don't wait for obvious signals

But this creates new problem:
- Early entry → Painful waiting through volatility → Temptation to exit
- Hard to "sit tight" when early position is down 30%

## Resolution Attempt #2: Time Horizon

Maybe it's about time frames:
- **Short-term**: Be patient, don't force trades
- **Long-term**: Be aggressive on conviction ideas

But evidence mixed:
- Some of my best trades were patient entries (waited for pullback)
- Some of my worst were "early believer" mistakes (Snapchat)

## What the Data Shows

Analyzed my trades:
- **Early entries**: 65% win rate, but larger drawdowns
- **Patient entries**: 75% win rate, smaller drawdowns
- **Held >12 months**: 85% win rate, 4x better returns

**Pattern**: Patient entry + patient holding = Best results

## Current Thinking

The two beliefs might not actually conflict:

**Synthesis**: 
- Be patient for the RIGHT opportunity (high quality + reasonable price)
- But when you find it, be decisive (don't wait for "perfect")
- Then sit tight through volatility (conviction required)

The key is **conviction**:
- Without conviction: Wait longer
- With conviction: Act decisively, then hold

## Remaining Tension

Still struggling with:
- How much conviction is enough?
- What if "early" is just "wrong"?
- How to distinguish opportunity from trap?

**2023 example**: AI boom
- Early believers (Jan 2023) up 200%+
- Patient investors (waited for correction) missed it
- Was this luck or skill?

## Open Questions

1. Is "early believer" wisdom just survivorship bias?
2. How to build conviction quickly (to act early)?
3. Can patience and aggression coexist, or is this unresolved?

## Practical Approach (For Now)

Working framework:
1. Be patient by default (don't force trades)
2. When high conviction forms → Act decisively
3. After entry → Extreme patience (years, not months)
4. Size position for ability to sit through volatility

This keeps me out of most trades (patient) but aggressive on the few that matter.

**Success metric**: Not how much I trade, but quality of decisions.

This tension isn't fully resolved. Maybe that's okay. Synthesis is ongoing.
