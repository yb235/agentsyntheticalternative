# Investment Strategy Reflection

## Core Philosophy

After 5 years of trading, I've learned that successful investing is 80% psychology and 20% analysis.

The most important rule: **Never trade when emotional or tired.**

## My Evolution

**2017-2018**: Started with technical analysis, following Minervini, O'Neil patterns
- Win rate was mediocre (55%)
- Made money but not consistently

**2019-2020**: Discovered fundamental analysis, started reading annual reports
- Win rate improved to 70%
- But still suffered from emotional trading

**2021-2022**: Major losses taught me about position sizing and risk management
- Lost 15% of portfolio in one bad trade (SOXS disaster)
- Realized that size matters more than being right

**2023-Present**: Focus on process over outcomes
- Win rate is 85%+ when following my rules
- Losses are small and controlled
- Wins are allowed to run

## Key Lessons

1. **Coffee is my enemy**: 6 out of 7 major losses happened after drinking coffee
   - Coffee makes me restless and impulsive
   - Solution: No coffee before 2 PM

2. **Macro trades always fail**: My win rate on macro directional trades is 0%
   - I don't have edge in macro
   - Stick to bottom-up company analysis

3. **Sitting tight is underrated**: Best returns came from holding conviction positions
   - NVDA: 18 months, 300% gain
   - SE: 12 months, 150% gain
   - Both required patience through drawdowns

## Rules I Must Follow

DO:
- Check mental state before every trade
- Require written thesis before entry
- Position size for psychological comfort (max 10% per position)
- Hold conviction ideas through volatility

DON'T:
- Trade after coffee
- Make macro directional bets
- Add to losing positions
- Exit early due to impatience

The hardest part is discipline. I know these rules work, but following them consistently is the real challenge.
