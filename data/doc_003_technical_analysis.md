# Technical Analysis: My Journey from Believer to Skeptic

## Early Days (2017-2019)

Started as a true believer in technical analysis:
- Studied Minervini's SEPA methodology
- Learned cup-and-handle patterns
- Used MACD, RSI, moving averages religiously

**Results**: Mixed. Win rate around 55%, but losses were big.

## The Turning Point (2020)

Tesla case study changed everything:
- TA said "overextended, sell"
- Fundamentals said "just getting started"
- I sold at $300 (pre-split), it went to $1200

**Lesson**: TA can be actively harmful if it conflicts with fundamentals.

## Deeper Analysis (2021-2022)

Tracked all my trades for 2 years:
- Trades based primarily on TA: 47% win rate
- Trades based on fundamentals: 73% win rate
- Hybrid approach: 62% win rate

**Conclusion**: TA doesn't give me edge.

## Why TA Failed Me

1. **False signals**: More noise than signal, especially on daily charts
2. **Self-defeating**: If everyone sees the same pattern, it stops working
3. **Ignores value**: Can keep you out of great companies "too expensive"
4. **Psychological crutch**: Gives false confidence without substance

## Current Position (2023)

I've mostly abandoned TA, with one exception:
- **Weekly/Monthly charts**: Sometimes useful for overall trend
- **Daily charts**: Useless noise, ignore completely

**Focus now**: 
- Deep fundamental research
- Management quality assessment
- Industry trends and competitive positioning
- Long-term value creation

## The Contradiction

I still check charts sometimes. Old habits die hard.

But I've learned to not let them influence decisions. The chart is just price history, not future predictor.

## For Other Traders

If TA works for you, great. But test it rigorously:
- Track your results by method
- Separate TA-driven vs fundamental-driven trades
- Measure win rates and average returns
- Be honest about what actually works

For me, TA was a distraction from real analysis. Your mileage may vary.
